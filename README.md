# Twitter POS tagging

## Overview
This project involves the analysis of Twitter data to understand trends, user engagement, and other social dynamics. It utilizes various datasets and advanced statistical techniques to perform detailed explorations and generate insights that could assist in social media strategies and understanding user behavior.

## Datasets
The project uses several key datasets:
- `twitter_train.txt`: Contains training data for model building.
- `twitter_dev_no_tag.txt`: Development dataset without user tags for validation.
- `twitter_dev_ans.txt`: Answers for the development set to check predictions.
- `twitter_tags.txt`: List of tags used in tweets for tagging and categorization.

## File Descriptions
- `hmm.py`: Python script for applying Hidden Markov Models to analyze sequential data and trends in tweets.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or later
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib


## `hmm.py` Script Detailed Overview

### Purpose
The `hmm.py` script is designed to apply Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to the analysis of Twitter data, focusing on understanding and predicting sequences of tweets' behavior based on observed sequences of states such as topics and sentiments.

### Naive Bayes Algorithm in Twitter Analysis

#### Overview
The Naive Bayes algorithm is a probabilistic classifier used for classifying tweets into categories based on text content, under the assumption of feature independence.

#### How It Works
- **Probability Model**: Calculate the probability of each category based on the training data.
- **Feature Independence**: Assume independence among features (words) within the tweets.
- **Parameter Estimation**: Estimate probabilities of each word in a category.
- **Classification**: Assign tweets to categories with the highest probability based on their content.

#### Application
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Topic Detection**: Identify main themes or topics in tweets.

### Viterbi Algorithm in Twitter Analysis

#### Overview
The Viterbi algorithm is used to find the most likely sequence of hidden states based on the observed events, optimized through a dynamic programming approach.

#### How It Works
- **Initialization**: Start with initial state probabilities and the first observed event's impact.
- **Recursion**: For each new event, update the probability of each state, incorporating the likelihood of transitioning from previous states.
- **Termination and Path Backtracking**: Determine the most probable path of states across the observed sequence.

#### Application
- **Behavior Analysis**: Determine sequences of user behaviors such as posting or reacting.
- **Trend Detection**: Analyze evolving topics or sentiments over time.
